        <h2>Industrial</h2>
        <article class="genre">
            <p>Industrial is a genre in between Rock and Electronic music.
            It evolved out of the German post-war underground scene in the seventies, 
            and has been experimental and obscure ever since. There are five different aspects 
            of Industrial music that show a great deal of insight into this genre: organizational 
            autonomy, access to info, use of synth and anti-music, extra-musical elements, and shock tactics.
            The first one - organizational autonomy - can be traced back to the roots of the genre's name: Industrial 
            comes from Industrial Records, the first Industrial record company and more an extreme experiment than a real enterprise. 
            The name however is no coincidence: early Industrial criticizes contemporary art by going either backwards (dark retro/industrial age) 
            or forwards (dark cyber/futurism). Musical references to factory and industrial life (noise, machines) strengthen Industrial's name.
            Industrial however does not follow any rules but likes to create the illusion of a heavily organized machine.
            The song structure of Rock gets combined with the sound effects and instrumentation of electronic music, specifically Downtempo, 
            Techno, and Trance. Industrial has a slower, hypnotizing tempo compared to Rock and a pronounced, perfectly regular 
            (almost in a military fashion) rhythm that pounds throughout most Industrial tracks.
            Some people may mistake Industrial as Techno however it is nothing like Techno: there is no groove or soul within, only a dark, pulsing force 
            that is torn and tortured by its own resourceful consciousness. The forth aspect of Industrial, extra-musical elements, concerns visual art 
            and fashion, but most importantly performance art. Industrial culture is known for its extravagant music concerts. 
            The earliest music shows in the seventies already explored the outer limits of what is morally acceptable on stage and then leapt far and 
            wide over these limits. Not only on stage but also in cover art and lyrics, shock tactics are being used by Industrial: 
            references to fascism and Nazism, torture, self-mutilation, deviant sex, and psychotic, disturbing imagery or voices, 
            all intensified by the dark and heavy sound of Electronic Rock. But Industrial is anything but fascist; the music holds a mirror to 
            those who wrongfully believe so and teaches how people are easily manipulated by media and the visual. Industrial is a philosophical 
            meta-genre, which is why it values access to info. Industrial has always believed that music is unable to change the world. Yet it tries nevertheless, 
            resulting in a schizophrenic identity of aggression/noise versus melancholy/depression.</p>

        <h2>Metal</h2>
        <article class="genre">
            <p>Although for most people Heavy Metal is (correctly) a harder and faster type of Rock, the genre is actually a continuation of 
                “the Devil's music”: Blues. After Metal's experimental phase during the seventies, it lost a lot of its Blues influences and 
                evolved rapidly into a variety of different styles. Two aspects of Blues have always remained however: lyrics about sorrow, 
                nihilism, pain, tragedy, and a more concealed subtext revolving the Devil (though for Blues this was more a reputation than an 
                actual theme). Heavy Metal expanded on these aspects in an obsessive manner. Death, destruction, corpses, zombies, Satan, 
                pentagrams, evil themes, lots of black, torture, sharp and gothic artwork, and a hand symbol that both resembles the Devil's 
                horns and the letter “M”. These are the main elements of stereotypical Metal artwork/culture that have become so dominant that 
                anything else is almost an exception to the rule. The visual language of Metal - a symbolism of anything dark or evil - transcends 
                into corresponding fashion: black T-shirts with Metal artwork, black leather, wristbands with sharp pins, long sleazy hair, 
                black jeans and of course: metal. The term “Heavy Metal” describes well the two cornerstone aspects of the genre. It is heavy due 
                to more amplification and distortion than Rock and it is also very “metallic”, meaning technical/rational. Heavy Metal is an 
                overcharged engineer among genres, with highly technical unique elements such as blast beats, double bass drums, 12 string bass, 
                lightning guitar solos and difficult voice techniques (grunting, falsetto, opera, screeching, etc.). Riffs are even more important 
                than in Rock, and form the foundation around which many Metal songs are built. Many Metal riffs, especially early ones, 
                make use of the Tritone: a musical dissonant interval of three whole tones that conveys a sense of restlessness. As such, 
                the Tritone used to be associated with the Devil (Tritonus Diabolus in Musica Est) since the 18th century. What makes Metal 
                appealing as well is a strong tendency for the theatrical. Metal likes to be bombastic to fortify its message 
                (often of doom or evil), whether by classical elements, synth elements, more instrumentation, instrumental intermezzos, 
                or elaborate intros. Metal has considerable overlapping with Hardcore Punk, as both genres share a love for speed and heavy guitar music.

        <h2>Rock and Roll</h2>
        <article class="genre">
            <p>Rock n' Roll dissolves the musical barrier between young and old. That is to say: music expands from an adult-only form of entertainment 
                to a vital part of any adolescent or teen life. Rock 'n' Roll gives the youth their own sound, their genre, their personal revolution against 
                whatever their parents liked to listen. Rock 'n' Roll introduces the typical Rock instrument set-up, consisting of four to five 
                musicians (though three is possible as well): lead singer, lead guitar, rhythm guitar, drums, and bass 
                (though the singer could also play an instrument). Rock 'n' Roll is based on the Jump Blues rhythm, with a heavily 
                accentuated backbeat. Rock 'n' Roll is even faster than its direct predecessors Early Rhythm 'n' Blues and Jump Blues, with less 
                emphasis on bass and a replacement of the double bass by the electric bass. The etymology of “Rock 'n' Roll” reveals its subtext: 
                the phrase is old African-American slang for sex. Of course not all Rock 'n' Roll songs deal about sex, but many were utterly 
                shocking and hedonist for the conservative fifties and some artists put little effort in concealing their dirty mind. Rock 'n' Roll 
                itself has largely evaporated during consecutive decades. Apart from revivals of Rockabilly and Surf Rock in Japan, 
                the music is mostly considered a thing of the past. However, retro interest in earlier subcultures (fashion, design, and music) 
                of the thirties (Swing) and the fifties (Rock 'n' Roll) prove that Rock 'n' Roll can excite contemporary youth as much as it could 
                in the fifties. Rock 'n' Roll after all equals tempo and energy; it compels people to lose themselves and become wild, lawless, 
                hedonist - to become Rock and Roll.</p>

        <h2>Punk</h2>
        <article class="genre">
            <p> In the beginning Punk formed the antipode for what New Wave would later become: mass-appeal, interest from adults, 
                heavy post-production, stardom, eclecticism. The exact same trademarks of Progressive and Stadium Rock from the early seventies 
                which fueled Punk's revolt in the first place. Rock had lost all connection with the young crowd and a return to the roots was far 
                past due. Punk mentality goes back beyond the seventies: the concept of short, powerful riffs and brief, energetic songs can be 
                traced to the roots of Power Pop and so called “power chords”.  Punk was almost a statement about ineptitude: anyone could do it. 
                And indeed, some famous artists couldn't even read notes or barely play guitar. As a living paradigm of protest, Punk knew how to bring 
                music back to the youth: raw, sincere, lo-fi, spontaneous. This is very similar to what happened in Jamaica around the same time: Punk and 
                Reggae were brothers in arms, protesting against authority and returning music to the streets. Punk is Robin Hood in leather and pins. 
                A culture of DIY and sleaziness (drugs, vandalism, squatting, riots, graffiti) blends in with such epitome of enfant terrible, made by and 
                for “punks”: kids who are up to no good. And this is what has made Punk attractive during all these years. Just like Garage Rock and Grunge, 
                Punk is raw: the shredded remains of all eclectic and “intellectual” Rock genres down the meat grinder.Technically, Punk uses a faster 
                tempo than most Rock genres with sparse instrumentation. Chords are simple but powerful and vocals are usually with a small dynamic range, 
                except when screamed. But Post-Punk and New Wave use more extensive song structure, vocal range and instrumentation. A technical common 
                ground seems therefore far off. What binds these different styles is the power of idea and a strong emphasis on the visual, particularly 
                fashion. The whole era of Punk and Wave is dominated by powerful imagery, shocking personalities and new technology. Punk focusses on concept and message. 
                These are not songs about everyday life or personal feelings. Punk is about the fabric of society in a pessimist, cynical, undermining, or 
                melancholic manner.</p>

        <h2>Alternative</h2>
        <article class="genre">
            <p>Alternative Rock became a huge phenomenon during the nineties and virtually dominated the entire Rock scene during that decade. 
               But the term is rather vague, as what Rock genre from the mid-eighties onwards could really be considered mainstream? Rock has 
               always been the problem child of music, violently kicking around and upsetting whomever it can. Alternative Rock is therefore a 
               collection of different styles from the mid-eighties till the end of the millennium, yet with more common ground than contemporary 
               Rock genres. Alternative or “Alt” Rock is recognizable by jangly guitars, lots of distortion pedals, distortion on amps, 
               sentimental or dark lyrics and sometimes small influences from synth. This has led to much “thicker” and heavier music, like an 
               angry wall of sound; especially compared to the rather bare Punk Rock. Songs are often longer than any other Rock super-genre 
               (apart from Prog Rock) and average tempo is lower than Rock 'n' Roll, Punk Rock, or Hardcore, making it fairly slow as far as Rock 
               goes.The name Indie Rock comes from the abbreviation of “independent” as in independent record label, also known as an “indie”. 
               Indies are smaller, less profit oriented companies as opposed to big-business major record companies, known as “majors”. 
               Indies were either a deliberate choice or the only resort for a large stream of young amateur bands. These starting musicians felt 
               either very strong about the integrity of their music, which they didn't want to jeopardize by the whims of major producers, or 
               they failed to break through into mainstream. The genre is still popular, but this has also to do with the fact that the term has 
               become an easy label for any raw, traditional, heavy Rock band that is hard to categorize. Retrospectively, a lot of bands that were 
               labeled (or even are being labeled) as “Alternative” weren't really. The word alternative just sounded pretty cool in conjunction with 
               Rock: it was a perfect marketing device that dwelled on a mainstream-phobia among adolescents and artists alike.</p>

            <h2>Contemporary</h2>
            <article class="genre">
            <p>For the lack of a proper name, “Contemporary” Rock signifies all new Rock genres in the 21st century. Although this may sound 
                like a meaningless term for the sake of creating a false portmanteau, Contemporary Rock genres share common characteristics, 
                though not technical ones. Generally speaking, two dominant forces control and shape the rise of these genres 
                (and not only in the world of Rock music): recycling and eclecticism. Cut-and-paste techniques form new genres out of old ones. 
                Choice is power and originality/experimentation is overrated. Rock bands focus on the quality of their music and the search of a 
                personal sound, instead of desperately christening a new crusade in the form of genre. A technical definition of Contemporary Rock 
                is lacking. The genre uses different influences to create a new concept of Rock music. Synthesizers - once revolutionary and 
                exciting - have become an ordinary Rock instrument like guitar or drums. With influences from Pop, Electronic and even Folk, 
                anything is possible. One could say that Contemporary Rock is defined by being any kind of Rock different from the past. 
                But not even this is true, as Garage Rock and Post-Punk revivals form the exception to that rule. The power of Contemporary Rock 
                lies in reaching out and building bridges towards other music genres</p>

            <h2>Pop</h2>
            <article class="genre">
            <p>Pop music is difficult to define. The content of its definition has shifted throughout the course of time. What started as a 
                network of white songwriters manufacturing premade songs for crooners and groups (Tin Pan Alley), became an individual crusade 
                (singer/songwriter) and eventually a herald for integration and emancipation, where blacks as artists and teens as audience were 
                given recognition and a platform. From the sixties until the eighties, Rock forms the basis for Pop, but that foundation shifts 
                towards House in the nineties and R&B/Rap in the nillies. Whatever that core may be, Pop is always a lighter, more accessible 
                variant with catchy, pronounced melodies, but not too complex. Pop songs are always 100% radio friendly, i.e. they are edited to 
                play up to four minutes or less and have politically correct lyrics, often bordering on shallowness. Pop has plain song structures, 
                which are easy to memorize and so are the chords or melodies. A strong focus on video clips and visual performance have become 
                staples in the Pop industry throughout the years, as most Pop does try to sell. More than any other super-genre, Pop has a commercial
                 nature, or - in better terms - Pop transmutes in what sells the most. The word “Pop” is short for popular music and first coined 
                 in the fifties. Crooners from that decade were the first to be mentioned as “pop”. These artists had a tremendous popular appeal 
                 and their songwriters would seek inspiration from the most diverse genres in order to attain the perfect success formula. This 
                 means that at first Pop was not seen as a separate genre, but a collection of music from different genres that are the most 
                 popular. This is of course a matter of perspective. But although Pop may be vague as a group, especially in the beginning, its 
                 various subsequent subgenres are often well-defined. The strength of Pop music lies in a denial of genre or niche: Pop does not try 
                 to bring a new subculture or convey a message. It wants to include anyone and everyone and just have fun. Pop wants to be 
                 approachable: no barrier, no threshold, no shame. Anything goes. But what exactly defines Pop music then? Pop is whatever gets the most 
                 appeal from people, the common denominator between different music tastes and the most flexible, applicable of styles. Never too extreme 
                 in one aspect or another, yet never too mundane or boring; Pop seeks to catch the attention fast and hold it, but never in an offensive or 
                 disturbing way.</p>

            <h2>Country</h2>
            <article class="genre">
            <p>For many non-Americans unfamiliar with the music, Country feels like a small and insignificant genre. However, Country has been the 
                United States' most selling genre for several decades and still is among the top selling categories according to numerous statistics. 
                The genre has always been closely linked with radio and was one of the first music genres to go on the airwaves and into the living room 
                of many Americans. Because that's what Country is all about: everyday life, family, home. It is no coincidence many Country bands are named 
                as a family and/or are actual families. Strong family values form a common theme throughout Country's history, but sometimes a darker reality 
                of liquor, drugs, adultery and criminal behavior dispels that picture perfect illusion. Then, such a predicament becomes a catalyst that 
                creates diversity within the genre. But Country deals about more than just family. God and the motherland form two other recurring core values 
                of Country's content. The lyrical subject of faith has created a link with Gospel (Country Gospel), and a distance with people of other 
                religions. Being as old as it is, Country works mostly with very classic (string) instruments: banjo, fiddle, acoustic guitar, 
                violin and harmonica. The genre has refrained during later decades from incorporating many other instruments, especially electronic 
                ones. With a slow tempo and a sparse (often acoustic) set-up, Country puts great emphasis on voice. Many male and female Country 
                singers are renowned for their voice, perhaps the most important instrument of the genre. Just like Folk Rock, the voice should have 
                the power to convey emotional stories or ballads. Duets, especially man and woman talking about love, are also common within the 
                genre. Country is based on traditional ballads or tunes with rather plain melodies and chords, similar to Folk music 
                (which was an important influence on the genre).</p>

            <h2>Rhythm and blues</h2>
            <article class="genre">
            <p>Like the name implies, Rhythm 'n' Blues (“RnB”) is the powerful combination of two old music genres. Gospel (the Rhythm) on one 
                hand, which provides an infectious groovy tempo that was already noticeable in its early barbershop days with handclapping and 
                rhythmical vibrating voices. Blues on the other hand, which delivers warm chords and rich bass. “Gospel & Blues” combines diverse 
                musical elements and is therefore a highly flexible hybrid genre, forming a bridge between many super-genres. RnB can be the 
                middle ground between Blues and Rock, but also between Rap and Pop or Gospel and House, which makes it one of the most accessible 
                music genres. The cornerstone aspect of all R&B is the backbeat: the 2nd and 4th beat of each bar becomes accentuated, creating a strong 
                cadence. Backbeat makes RnB highly danceable, eventually leading to Disco and the concept of nightlife dance culture and clubbing. RnB is also 
                known for more complex rhythms and drums; the introduction of the breakbeat or a high emphasis on percussion. Instrumentation follows out of 
                the basic Blues set-up: guitar, bass, and drums. Yet almost always one or more instruments are added, selected by their ability to create a 
                richer sound and radiate a warm, cozy feeling: violins, synth, vibraphone, Hammond organ, or brass horns. Although RnB is rather a 
                diverse collection of genres, the common themes of optimism, love and joy recur in all of them. A positive vibe, amplified by 
                invigorating performances by artists with a charismatic, radiant appearance, makes RnB among the most popular of genres. 
                Such joy is a clear rupture with RnB's predecessor, Blues. Soul is a secular and more pop oriented continuation of Gospel: gentle and 
                emotional songs (usually about love) with high production values but even more benevolent willpower. Soul actually refers to a personal 
                quality of high morality: a Soul person is a righteous being. Soul was the dominant mainstream music genre in the first half of the sixties 
                and remained popular ever since. Funk evolves out of Soul but reaches out to Jazz and a bit of Rock to create even more rhythmical music, 
                based on a single chord. Funk brings a repetitive pulsing groove around which every song is built, making the genre more dance-friendly 
                than Soul. Funk likes to use electric bass or electro synth distortions to create a “greasy” sound, while the percussion section is hardly 
                distinguishable from the melody or bass section: all the instruments have become one - the Funk groove. The word funk is derived from 
                old slang for the smell of sex: enough said. Urban is the latest development of R&B, where it blends with Rap, Pop and a bit of Latin into a 
                fusion that should function equally well for nightclubbing, album sales, live concerts or radio performances. Therefore Urban has become a 
                very dominant music genre and often criticized for commercialism and shallowness.  </p>

            <h2>Gospel</h2>
            <article class="genre">
            <p>Gospel evolved from the fragile voice from black slaves into an undeniably huge genre with many subgenres. Gospel shakes 
                off pretty fast its racial dimension: black and white join hand in hand to sing the song of God. Because Gospel is more about faith 
                than about race; about believing in a better world and future and connecting different souls. As Gospel expands and diversifies, 
                questions are raised about the integrity of some artists and the music itself. Gospel is rarely a part of mainstream music media but without it, 
                there would be no Rhythm 'n' Blues or perhaps even no popular music at all. However, in many churches and religious communities 
                (especially in the southern part of the US) Gospel lives on strongly and is heavily produced, sung and experienced in sermons 
                that induce ecstatic bliss in listeners, the likes other subcultures have never seen. Gospel may be the core of many other genres but is has Some
                of it's own characteristics. Vocals for example, are usually sung in a “call-and-response” manner: a legacy from old church sermons, where the 
                priest sings one part and the choir responds that same part. Not to create a cappella backbeat rhythm (although it was), but simply because of 
                the fact that most church attendants were illiterate. Early Gospel only had piano accompaniment. Percussion was achieved by voice and 
                handclapping. However, one should not underestimate the amount of rhythm achieved in traditional Gospel, another key characteristic of the 
                music. Other pioneering popular music genres work with whatever set-up they could find or afford; easy to produce instruments like banjo or 
                sometimes rudimentary tools such as washboards, kazoos, or jugs. Modern or contemporary Gospel draws cues from any genre and therefore works 
                with a whole variety of instruments.</p>

            <h2>Blues</h2>
            <article class="genre">
            <p>At first, Blues was dominantly associated with anything vice; it was regarded as the song of outlaws and criminals. But Blues must rather
                be seen as an outlet or cry for the people on the border of society: the poor, blind, unfortunate and particularly, the black. Blues 
                before R&B was regrettably known as “race music”. Blues wins-over hearts because that's where it comes from. It is sincere, but also 
                blunt. Blues music (also known as Blue Music) is characterized by use of guitar, single at first and later complemented by drums and bass. 
                Songs are written in an AAB rhyme, in harmonic sequences and onto a 12 bar 4/4 rhythm. Most recognizable about Blues is a progression of 
                chords, in a call and response manner. Chords also make use of blue notes: notes with an altered pitch. This gives Blues a typical melancholic, 
                mournful sound, although for black musicians such connotation never existed. In their music they sought atonement for their deeds. It is often said 
                that Blues is the opposite of Gospel: that the latter is the music of God, where the former is the music of the Devil.</p>

            <h2>Jazz</h2>
            <article class="genre">
            <p>Jazz is music performed by an ensemble of players, each (very) specialized and proficient in their respective instrument. 
                The usual Jazz instruments are: trumpets, saxophones, clarinets, trombones, string-bass, and piano alongside drums and a 
                jazz-guitar. The interaction between these players is crucial. Compared to Rock or Blues, Jazz musicians follow no completely 
                predetermined scores. They have to “feel” what the others are about to play and how the music will evolve. Yes, there are chords 
                and melodies forming an identifiable foundation for each song, but improvisation and instantaneous experimentation are never 
                absent. In a way, true Jazz music can only be experienced live. Each performance is supposed to be different. Jazz provides an interesting 
                combination of (lower class) African American folk music with (upper class) European amusement and classical music.  Jazz ensembles are divided 
                in different sections: the rhythm section (bass, drums, and piano) provide a steady beat throughout the track, while the melody section (horns) 
                plays the chorus altogether and afterwards separately with solo's. The power of Jazz lies in its rich contrast: improvised versus predetermination, 
                chaos versus control and light and gentle sounds versus sharp and shrill tones.</p>

            <h2>Jamaican</h2>
            <article class="genre">
            <p>Jamaican music is regrettably often reduced to its most popular export Reggae. Reggae's international appeal quickly surpassed the 
                threshold which defines world music. This becomes very clear when compared to the music of neighbouring countries like Cuba and 
                Haiti. But there are more Jamaican music genres that all have become more popular than world music. What is even more important 
                than their popularity is the fact that Jamaican music creates a critical shackle between Rock, Rap and Dance. Almost all Jamaican 
                music genres share certain characteristic. Jamaican music is focused on recording, not performing. Live gigs were virtually non-existent 
                and vinyl reigned supreme. Because of sound systems, Jamaican music is made to be played outdoors (with the exception of Dancehall). This is 
                particularly noticeable in the dedication (mainly amplification) on the drum and bass parts. Another characteristic of all Jamaican music is 
                a strong emphasis on the offbeat. This gives the music a laidback sound, ideal for warm outdoor weather and smoking marihuana. Indeed, 
                cannabis - cultivated on Jamaica itself - is also partly responsible for the way most Jamaican music sounds, although its influence on the 
                genre must not be exaggerated.</p>

            <h2>Rap and Hip-Hop music</h2>
            <article class="genre">
            <p>Hip Hop is not a genre, but a huge subculture encompassing a whole lot more than just music. Hip Hop consists of what is known 
                as “the Four Elements”: breakdancing, graffiti, turntablism (mixing and scratching, the work of the DJ), and rapping 
                (the work of the MC); a harmony of dance, visual art, spoken word, and technology. But Hip Hop also has its own customs, 
                an idiosyncratic “code”, enriching and defining the subculture: gang visual language for a start, or an obsession with clean 
                sneakers to show respect for personal property when rappers could barely afford a second pair of shoes. And let's not 
                forget “Bling Bling”: often misinterpreted for status symbols, these heavy, exuberant golden necklaces and rings represent ancient
                African warrior tribe symbols. Because Hip Hop is first and foremost a powerful stance. All Rap or Hip Hop music consists of two equally 
                important parts: the beat and the rhyme. The beat used to be made by certain old Funk (or Disco) records which featured 
                breakdowns: sections with only the drummer (and bass) playing. These sections were used to create a continuous (looped) breakbeat. 
                Sampling, a technique of cutting and pasting small sounds from existing records, was used to complement the breakbeat with melody, 
                bass and sound effects. Though controversial from a legal point of view, the work some artists devoted to create the perfect beat 
                is extraordinary and most samples were never recognized. Since the late eighties, electronic samplers could store and record a 
                variety of samples, leading to a torrent of Rap productions. The real power of Rap lies in the opportunity to convey elaborate and 
                profound messages, thanks to the continuous use of lyrics throughout the music. With more words per song than any other genre, Rap can 
                amuse, protest, or connect in ways other genres cannot. Especially the latter is often forgotten: early Rap tried to end ghetto 
                poverty, bigotry and racism by reaching out to white audiences, connecting remote subcultures. Rap did not only inherit the concept 
                of sound systems, DJ's with turntables, and toasting from Jamaica, but also the love for cannabis. Besides Jamaican music, no 
                super-genre is as connected with the drug as Rap, though many rappers have expressed strong anti-drug messages. The aural 
                psychedelic effect of marihuana synergizes well with the repetition of a looped breakbeat combined with unexpected and atmospheric 
                samples, while the psychological effect on reasoning, associating, and verbalizing facilitates high-tempo rapping. One must of 
                course also not forget the incredibly abundant vocabulary of Hip Hop slang, partly as a consequence of marihuana use.</p>

            <h2>Techno</h2>
            <article class="genre">
            <p>Techno is a bit like an abstract painting: it is an impressionistic interpretation of the Funk groove inspired by futuristic visions, 
                nihilistic views, electronic circuits, or the networks of the inner mind. It is the most introverted of all super-genres - the quiet 
                thinker - who likes to fiddle with technology until the wee hours of the morning. More than anything else, Techno is the father of all 
                electronic Dance. Together with House, it gave offspring to countless genres. Originally, Techno was more sociologically constrained than 
                nowadays.  Techno bass lines are based on Funk grooves, but completely electronically made. Techno uses sounds that hover in between the 
                natural and the artificial, between analogue and digital; sounds that may be real or may not. Techno's funky groove becomes dance by 
                introducing repetition and more pronunciation on each 4/4 beat. Bassline and beat work strongly together and are often deeper and harder than 
                House. Each and every Techno track ever created has been a quest for finding the perfect rhythm through a careful combination of basslines and 
                drum kicks. Techno is usually also a tiny bit faster than House, with average BPM ranging between 130 and 140. Strong influences from Electro, 
                Techno's direct forefather, surface through technological blips and sounds, which accompany the rhythm without becoming melody 
                (like Trance) or ambience (like House). A very important aspect of Techno is that it's the only Dance super-genre that is (almost) always 
                instrumental. House, Trance, Hardcore and others often feature vocal samples. Techno almost never; it symbolizes the emancipation of 
                electronic rhythm. The rhythm is the star, the front member; there is no need for voice. In the nineties, the word Techno becomes often used 
                as an umbrella term for all Dance music. It is of course advisable to refrain from such confusing and incorrect terminology, but it does 
                illustrate the exponentially rising popularity of the genre at the time. Real Techno is rather limited in its amount of subgenres; its purist 
                and minimalist approach allow little room for a large variety of styles. Techno hasn't produced new styles in quite some time</p>

            <h2>House</h2>
            <article class="genre">
            <p>House, daughter of mother Disco, is the stereotypical feel-good dance floor music with a steady beat. The most important word in the previous
               sentence is “feel-good”. House sets itself apart from other Dance genres by providing groove and soul. House is digital Rhythm 'n' Blues 
               with a feeling of playfulness, warmth and compassion. Without her focus on positive vibes, she becomes another super-genre. The 
               revolutionary rise of House (and later Techno, Hardcore, and Trance) was accelerated by synergetic circumstances. Number one: new 
               drum computers and electronic music instruments emerged in the early eighties, which made music making affordable for a single 
               person and even possible without education. Secondly, the discovery of XTC as the perfect party drug, finally accepted by the 
               masses thanks to more powerful beats and an escapist non-stop club (disco) culture. Thirdly, the shocking spread of AIDS, which 
               decimated the homosexual community in the early eighties and spread a wave of fear. Because of this, House music became a substitute 
               for sex, as casual sex was deemed too dangerous. As the matter of fact, the gay crowd preferred to hang around longer in clubs 
               (instead of going home with a partner) and engage in sexual dancing, sweating, teasing, touching and losing itself on XTC 
               (and other drugs) in the music. All this led to longer parties, longer DJ sessions, harder beats, more ecstatic sounds and the search 
               for a musical substitute for pleasure: this is House music. House is defined by a steady straight 4/4 drum beat, ranging somewhere between 
               120 and 130 bpm. House has a pronounced kick drum on the quarter beat of the bar, which is defined as a “four to the floor” rhythm. Of all 
               Dance genres, House diverts the least of its average tempo (123-125bpm), which makes it easy to mix different records. A warm, soulful bass 
               groove or R&B influences are other stereotypical House components.</p>

            <h2>Downtempo</h2>
            <article class="genre">
            <p>Downtempo is a collection of primarily electronic music with an average tempo lower than usual (below 110 bpm), hence its name. 
                Because of such a low tempo, the music is generally not meant for dancing and seldom live performed. Downtempo is music to listen 
                to in a natural (read: non-musical) environment. Downtempo music is often featured in film soundtracks, on albums for home 
                listening, in public places, or… at the university. Early Downtempo evolved out of academic experiments with the first electronic 
                music instruments. This can even be traced back to the 1920s, when the very first electronic sound was produced, thanks to 
                Léon Theremin and his homonymous instrument. To these researchers, Downtempo was not particularly slow. Only many decades later, 
                after the arrival of much faster electronic dance genres, was the term “Downtempo” applied to this music. Sometimes Downtempo is 
                simply referred to as “Electronic” as opposed to (Electronic) Dance (Music). Downtempo puts greater emphasis on sounds and sound 
                experimentation than most super-genres. The whole history of Downtempo has been about exploring and discovering new techniques and 
                sounds, and gently expanding on its discoveries. Downtempo does not choose between acoustic or electronic, it includes whatever it can to 
                produce the perfect sound. The most important aspect of Downtempo however, is a radically different approach on music in general. Instead 
                of working with (serial) song structure, most songs are non-serial: they evolve slowly and gradually by repetition instead of structured 
                patterns. Within this seamlessly endless repetition, the mind is being taken on a transcendental journey. With no pattern, no point of 
                orientation, there is no more song, only music. Downtempo asks questions about what music is, instead of being an answer like other 
                genres.</p>
