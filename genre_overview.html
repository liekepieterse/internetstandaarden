                <h2>Industrial</h2>
                <p>Industrial is a genre in between Rock and Electronic music.<br>
                    It evolved out of the German post-war underground scene in the seventies, and has been
                    experimental and obscure ever since. There
                    are five different aspects of Industrial music that show a great deal of insight into this
                    genre: organizational
                    autonomy, access to info, use of synth and anti-music, extra-musical elements, and shock
                    tactics.</p>
                <p>The first one - organizational autonomy - can be traced back to the roots of the genre's name:
                    Industrial
                    comes from Industrial Records, the first Industrial record company and a more extreme
                    experiment than a real enterprise.
                    The name however is no coincidence: early Industrial criticizes contemporary art by going either
                    backwards (dark retro/industrial age)
                    or forwards (dark cyber/futurism). Musical references to factory and industrial life (noise,
                    machines) strengthen Industrial's name.</p>
                <p>Industrial does not follow any rules but likes to create the illusion of a heavily organized
                    machine.
                    The song structure of Rock gets combined with the sound effects and instrumentation of
                    electronic music, specifically Downtempo,
                    Techno, and Trance. Industrial has a slower, hypnotizing tempo compared to Rock and a
                    pronounced, perfectly regular
                    (almost in a military fashion) rhythm that pounds throughout most Industrial tracks.</p>
                <p>Some people may mistake Industrial as Techno, however it is nothing like Techno: there is no
                    groove or soul within, only a dark, pulsing force
                    that is torn and tortured by its own resourceful consciousness. </p>
                <p>The fourth aspect of Industrial, extra-musical elements, concerns visual art and fashion, but most
                    importantly performance art. Industrial
                    culture is known for its extravagant music concerts. The earliest music shows in the seventies
                    already explored the outer limits of what is
                    morally acceptable on stage, and then leapt far and wide over these limits. Not only on stage but
                    also in cover art and lyrics, shock tactics are
                    being used by Industrial: references to fascism and Nazism, torture, self-mutilation, deviant
                    sex, and psychotic, disturbing imagery or voices,
                    all intensified by the dark and heavy sound of Electronic Rock. But Industrial is anything but
                    fascist; the music holds a mirror to
                    those who wrongfully believe so and teaches how people are easily manipulated by media and the
                    visual. Industrial is a philosophical
                    meta-genre, which is why it values access to info. </p>
                <p>Industrial has always believed that music is unable to change the world. Yet it tries
                    nevertheless,
                    resulting in a schizophrenic identity of aggression/noise versus melancholy/depression.</p>

                <h2>Metal</h2>
                <p>Although for most people, Heavy Metal is (correctly) a harder and faster type of Rock, the genre
                    is actually a continuation of
                    “the Devil's music”: Blues. </p>
                <p>After Metal's experimental phase during the seventies, it lost a lot of its Blues influences and
                    evolved rapidly into a variety of different styles. Two aspects of Blues have always remained:
                    lyrics about sorrow,
                    nihilism, pain, tragedy, and a more concealed subtext revolving around the Devil (though for Blues
                    this
                    was more a reputation than an
                    actual theme). Heavy Metal expanded on these aspects in an obsessive manner. Death, destruction,
                    corpses, zombies, Satan,
                    pentagrams, evil themes, lots of black, torture, sharp and gothic artwork, and a hand symbol
                    that both resembles the Devil's
                    horns and the letter “M”. These are the main elements of stereotypical Metal artwork/culture
                    that have become so dominant that
                    anything else is almost an exception to the rule. The visual language of Metal - a symbolism of
                    anything dark or evil - transcends
                    into corresponding fashion: black T-shirts with Metal artwork, black leather, wristbands with
                    sharp pins, long sleazy hair,
                    black jeans and of course: metal.</p>
                <p>The term “Heavy Metal” describes well the two cornerstone aspects of the genre. It is heavy due
                    to more amplification and distortion than Rock, and it is also very “metallic”, meaning
                    technical/rational. </p>
                <p>Heavy Metal is an overcharged engineer among genres, with highly technical unique elements such
                    as blast beats, double bass
                    drums, 12-string bass, lightning guitar solos and difficult voice techniques (grunting,
                    falsetto, opera, screeching, etc.). Riffs
                    are even more important than in Rock, and form the foundation around which many Metal songs are
                    built. Many Metal riffs, especially
                    early ones, make use of the Tritone: a musical dissonant interval of three whole tones that
                    conveys a sense of restlessness. As such,
                    the Tritone used to be associated with the Devil (Tritonus Diabolus in Musica Est) since the
                    18th century.</p>
                <p>What makes Metal appealing as well is a strong tendency for the theatrical. Metal likes to be
                    bombastic to fortify its message
                    (often of doom or evil), whether by classical elements, synth elements, more instrumentation,
                    instrumental intermezzos,
                    or elaborate intros.</p>

                <h2>Rock and Roll</h2>
                <p>Rock n' Roll dissolves the musical barrier between young and old. That is to say: music expands
                    from an adult-only form of entertainment
                    to a vital part of any adolescent or teen life. Rock 'n' Roll gives the youth their own sound,
                    their genre, their personal revolution against
                    whatever their parents liked to listen.</p>
                <p>Rock 'n' Roll introduces the typical Rock instrument set-up, consisting of four to five musicians
                    (though three is possible as well): lead
                    singer, lead guitar, rhythm guitar, drums, and bass (though the singer could also play an
                    instrument).</p>
                <p>Rock 'n' Roll is based on the Jump Blues rhythm, with a heavily accentuated backbeat. It is even
                    faster than its direct
                    predecessors Early Rhythm 'n' Blues and Jump Blues, with less emphasis on bass and a replacement
                    of the double bass by the electric bass.</p>
                <p>The etymology of “Rock 'n' Roll” reveals its subtext: the phrase is old African-American slang
                    for sex. Of course not all Rock 'n' Roll songs
                    deal about sex, but many were utterly shocking and hedonist for the conservative fifties and
                    some artists put little effort in concealing their
                    dirty mind.</p>
                <p>Rock 'n' Roll itself has largely evaporated during consecutive decades. Apart from revivals of
                    Rockabilly and Surf Rock in Japan,
                    the music is mostly considered a thing of the past. However, retro interest in earlier
                    subcultures (fashion, design, and music)
                    of the thirties (Swing) and the fifties (Rock 'n' Roll) prove that Rock 'n' Roll can excite
                    contemporary youth as much as it could
                    in the fifties. Rock 'n' Roll after all equals tempo and energy; it compels people to lose
                    themselves and become wild, lawless,
                    hedonist - to become Rock and Roll.</p>

                <h2>Punk</h2>
                <p> In the beginning Punk formed the antipode for what New Wave would later become: mass-appeal,
                    interest from adults,
                    heavy post-production, stardom, eclecticism. The exact same trademarks of Progressive and
                    Stadium Rock from the early seventies
                    which fueled Punk's revolt in the first place.
                    Rock had lost all connection with the young crowd, and a return to the roots was far
                    past due.</p>
                <p>Punk mentality goes back beyond the seventies: the concept of short, powerful riffs
                    and brief, energetic songs can be
                    traced to the roots of Power Pop and so-called “power chords”.</p>
                <p>Punk was almost a statement about ineptitude: anyone could do it.
                    And indeed, some famous artists couldn't even read notes or barely play guitar.</p>
                <p>As a living paradigm of protest, Punk knew how to bring
                    music back to the youth: raw, sincere, lo-fi, spontaneous. This is very similar to what happened
                    in Jamaica around the same time: Punk and
                    Reggae were brothers in arms, protesting against authority and returning music to the streets.</p>
                <p>A culture of DIY and sleaziness (drugs, vandalism, squatting, riots, graffiti) blends in with
                    such epitome of enfant terrible, made by and
                    for “punks”: kids who are up to no good. And this is what has made Punk attractive during all
                    these years. Just like Garage Rock and Grunge,
                    Punk is raw: the shredded remains of all eclectic and “intellectual” Rock genres down the meat
                    grinder.</p>
                <p>Technically, Punk uses a faster
                    tempo than most Rock genres with sparse instrumentation. Chords are simple but powerful and
                    vocals are usually with a small dynamic range,
                    except when screamed. But Post-Punk and New Wave use more extensive song structure, vocal range
                    and instrumentation. A technical common
                    ground seems therefore far off. What binds these different styles is the power of idea and a
                    strong emphasis on the visual, particularly
                    fashion. The whole era of Punk and Wave is dominated by powerful imagery, shocking personalities
                    and new technology. Punk focuses on concept and message.
                    These are not songs about everyday life or personal feelings. Punk is about the fabric of
                    society in a pessimist, cynical, undermining, or
                    melancholic manner.</p>

            <article class="genre-l">
                <h2>Alternative or Indie</h2>
                <p>Alternative Rock became a huge phenomenon during the nineties and virtually dominated the entire
                    Rock scene during that decade.
                    But the term is rather vague, as what Rock genre from the mid-eighties onwards could really be
                    considered mainstream? Rock has
                    always been the problem child of music, violently kicking around and upsetting whomever it can.
                    Alternative Rock is therefore a
                    collection of different styles from the mid-eighties till the end of the millennium, yet with
                    more common ground than contemporary
                    Rock genres.</p>
                <p>Alternative or “Alt” Rock is recognizable by jangly guitars, lots of distortion
                    pedals, distortion on amps,
                    sentimental or dark lyrics and sometimes small influences from synth. This has led to much
                    “thicker” and heavier music, like an
                    angry wall of sound; especially compared to the rather bare Punk Rock. Songs are often longer
                    than any other Rock super-genre
                    (apart from Prog Rock) and average tempo is lower than Rock 'n' Roll, Punk Rock, or Hardcore,
                    making it fairly slow as far as Rock
                    goes.</p>
                <p>The name Indie Rock comes from the abbreviation of “independent” as in independent record
                    label, also known as an “indie”.</p>
                <p>Indies are smaller, less profit oriented companies as opposed to big-business major record
                    companies, known as “majors”.
                    Indies were either a deliberate choice or the only resort for a large stream of young amateur
                    bands. These starting musicians felt
                    either very strong about the integrity of their music, which they didn't want to jeopardize by
                    the whims of major producers, or
                    they failed to break through into mainstream. The genre is still popular, but this has also to
                    do with the fact that the term has
                    become an easy label for any raw, traditional, heavy Rock band that is hard to categorize.</p>
                <p>Retrospectively, a lot of bands that were
                    labeled (or even are being labeled) as “Alternative” weren't really. The word alternative just
                    sounded pretty cool in conjunction with
                    Rock: it was a perfect marketing device that dwelled on a mainstream-phobia among adolescents
                    and artists alike.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="genre-r">
                <h2>Contemporary</h2>
                <p>For the lack of a proper name, “Contemporary” Rock signifies all new Rock genres in the 21st
                    century.</p>
                <p>Although this may sound
                    like a meaningless term for the sake of creating a false portmanteau, Contemporary Rock genres
                    share common characteristics,
                    though not technical ones. Generally speaking, two dominant forces control and shape the rise of
                    these genres
                    (and not only in the world of Rock music): recycling and eclecticism. Cut-and-paste techniques
                    form new genres out of old ones.</p>
                <p>Choice is power and originality/experimentation is overrated. Rock bands focus on the quality of
                    their music and the search of a
                    personal sound, instead of desperately christening a new crusade in the form of genre. A
                    technical definition of Contemporary Rock
                    is lacking. </p>
                <p>The genre uses different influences to create a new concept of Rock music.
                    Synthesizers - once revolutionary and
                    exciting - have become an ordinary Rock instrument like guitar or drums. With influences from
                    Pop, Electronic and even Folk,
                    anything is possible.</p>
                <p>One could say that Contemporary Rock is defined by being any kind of Rock
                    different from the past.
                    But not even this is true, as Garage Rock and Post-Punk revivals form the exception to that
                    rule. The power of Contemporary Rock
                    lies in reaching out and building bridges towards other music genres</p>
            </article>

            <article class="genre-l">
                <h2>Pop</h2>
                <p>Pop music is difficult to define. The content of its definition has shifted throughout the course
                    of time. What started as a
                    network of white songwriters manufacturing premade songs for crooners and groups (Tin Pan
                    Alley), became an individual crusade
                    (singer/songwriter) and eventually a herald for integration and emancipation, where blacks as
                    artists and teens as audience were
                    given recognition and a platform. </p>
                <p>From the sixties until the eighties, Rock forms the basis for
                    Pop, but that foundation shifts
                    towards House in the nineties and R&B/Rap in the nillies. Whatever that core may be, Pop is
                    always a lighter, more accessible
                    variant with catchy, pronounced melodies, but not too complex.</p>
                <p>Pop songs are always 100% radio
                    friendly, i.e. they are edited to
                    play up to four minutes or less and have politically correct lyrics, often bordering on
                    shallowness. Pop has plain song structures,
                    which are easy to memorize, just like the chords or melodies. A strong focus on video clips and
                    visual performance have become
                    staples in the Pop industry throughout the years, as most Pop does try to sell. More than any
                    other super-genre, Pop has a commercial
                    nature, or - in better terms - Pop transmutes in what sells the most.</p>
                <p>The word “Pop” is short
                    for popular music and first coined
                    in the fifties. Crooners from that decade were the first to be mentioned as “pop”. These artists
                    had a tremendous popular appeal
                    and their songwriters would seek inspiration from the most diverse genres in order to attain the
                    perfect success formula. This
                    means that at first Pop was not seen as a separate genre, but a collection of music from
                    different genres that are the most
                    popular. This is of course a matter of perspective. But although Pop may be vague as a group,
                    especially in the beginning, its
                    various subsequent subgenres are often well-defined.</p>
                <p>The strength of Pop music lies in a denial
                    of genre or niche: Pop does not try
                    to bring a new subculture or convey a message. It wants to include anyone and everyone and just
                    have fun. Pop wants to be
                    approachable: no barrier, no threshold, no shame. Anything goes. But what exactly defines Pop
                    music then? Pop is whatever gets the most
                    appeal from people, the common denominator between different music tastes and the most flexible,
                    applicable of styles. Never too extreme
                    in one aspect or another, yet never too mundane or boring; Pop seeks to catch the attention fast
                    and hold it, but never in an offensive or
                    disturbing way.</p>

                <h2>Country</h2>
                <p>For many non-Americans unfamiliar with the music, Country feels like a small and insignificant
                    genre. However, Country has been the
                    United States' most selling genre for several decades and still is among the top-selling
                    categories according to numerous statistics.</p>
                <p>The genre has always been closely linked with radio and was one of the first music genres to go
                    on the airwaves and into the living room
                    of many Americans. Because that's what Country is all about: everyday life, family, home. It is
                    no coincidence many Country bands are named
                    as a family and/or are actual families. Strong family values form a common theme throughout
                    Country's history, but sometimes a darker reality
                    of liquor, drugs, adultery and criminal behavior dispels that picture-perfect illusion. Then,
                    such a predicament becomes a catalyst that
                    creates diversity within the genre.</p>
                <p>But Country deals about more than just family. God and the
                    motherland form two other recurring core values
                    of Country's content. The lyrical subject of faith has created a link with Gospel (Country
                    Gospel), and a distance with people of other
                    religions.</p>
                <p>Being as old as it is, Country works mostly with very classic (string) instruments:
                    banjo, fiddle, acoustic guitar,
                    violin and harmonica. The genre has refrained during later decades from incorporating many other
                    instruments, especially electronic
                    ones.</p>
                <p>With a slow tempo and a sparse (often acoustic) set-up, Country puts great emphasis on
                    voice. Many male and female Country
                    singers are renowned for their voice, perhaps the most important instrument of the genre. Just
                    like Folk Rock, the voice should have
                    the power to convey emotional stories or ballads. Duets, especially man and woman talking about
                    love, are also common within the
                    genre. Country is based on traditional ballads or tunes with rather plain melodies and chords,
                    similar to Folk music
                    (which was an important influence on the genre).</p>

                <h2>Rhythm and blues'</h2>
                <p>Like the name implies, Rhythm 'n' Blues (“RnB”) is the powerful combination of two old music
                    genres.</p>
                <p>Gospel (the Rhythm) on one
                    hand, which provides an infectious groovy tempo that was already noticeable in its early
                    barbershop days with handclapping and
                    rhythmical vibrating voices. Blues on the other hand, which delivers warm chords and rich bass.</p>
                <p>“Gospel & Blues” combines diverse
                    musical elements and is therefore a highly flexible hybrid genre, forming a bridge between many
                    super-genres. RnB can be the
                    middle ground between Blues and Rock, but also between Rap and Pop or Gospel and House, which
                    makes it one of the most accessible
                    music genres.</p>
                <p>The cornerstone aspect of all R&B is the backbeat: the 2nd and 4th beat of each
                    bar becomes accentuated, creating a strong
                    cadence. Backbeat makes RnB highly danceable, eventually leading to Disco and the concept of
                    nightlife dance culture and clubbing.</p>
                <p>RnB is also
                    known for more complex rhythms and drums; the introduction of the breakbeat or a high emphasis
                    on percussion. Instrumentation follows out of
                    the basic Blues set-up: guitar, bass, and drums. Yet almost always one or more instruments are
                    added, selected by their ability to create a
                    richer sound and radiate a warm, cozy feeling: violins, synth, vibraphone, Hammond organ, or
                    brass horns.</p>
                <p>Although RnB is rather a
                    diverse collection of genres, the common themes of optimism, love and joy recur in all of them.
                    A positive vibe, amplified by
                    invigorating performances by artists with a charismatic, radiant appearance, makes RnB among the
                    most popular of genres.
                    Such joy is a clear rupture with RnB's predecessor, Blues.</p>

                <h2>Gospel</h2>
                <p>Gospel evolved from the fragile voice from slaves into an undeniably huge genre with many
                    subgenres. Gospel shakes
                    off pretty fast its racial dimension: black and white join hand in hand to sing the song of God.
                    Because Gospel is more about faith
                    than about race; about believing in a better world and future and connecting different souls. As
                    Gospel expands and diversifies,
                    questions are raised about the integrity of some artists and the music itself. Gospel is rarely
                    a part of mainstream music media but without it,
                    there would be no Rhythm 'n' Blues or perhaps even no popular music at all.</p>
                <p>In many churches and religious communities
                    (especially in the southern part of the US) Gospel lives on strongly and is heavily produced,
                    sung and experienced in sermons
                    that induce ecstatic bliss in listeners, the likes other subcultures have never seen.</p>
                <p>Gospel may be the core of many other genres but it has some
                    of its own characteristics. Vocals for example, are usually sung in a “call-and-response”
                    manner: a legacy from old church sermons, where the
                    priest sings one part and the choir responds that same part. Not to create a cappella backbeat
                    rhythm (although it was), but simply because
                    most church attendants were illiterate. Early Gospel only had piano accompaniment.
                    Percussion was achieved by voice and
                    handclapping. However, one should not underestimate the amount of rhythm achieved in traditional
                    Gospel, another key characteristic of the
                    music.</p>
                <p>Other pioneering popular music genres work with whatever set-up they could find or
                    afford; easy to produce instruments like banjo or
                    sometimes rudimentary tools such as washboards, kazoos, or jugs.</p>
                <p>Modern or contemporary Gospel
                    draws cues from any genre and therefore works
                    with a whole variety of instruments.</p>

                <h2>Blues</h2>
                <p>At first, Blues was dominantly associated with anything vice; it was regarded as the song of
                    outlaws and criminals. But Blues must rather
                    be seen as an outlet or cry for the people on the border of society: the poor, blind,
                    unfortunate and particularly, the black.</p>
                <p>Blues before R&B was regrettably known as “race music”. Blues wins-over hearts because
                    that's where it comes from. It is sincere, but also
                    blunt.</p>
                <p>Blues music (also known as Blue Music) is characterized by use of guitar, single at first
                    and later complemented by drums and bass.
                    Songs are written in an AAB rhyme, in harmonic sequences and onto a 12 bar 4/4 rhythm. Most
                    recognizable about Blues is a progression of
                    chords, in a call and response manner. Chords also make use of blue notes: notes with an altered
                    pitch. This gives Blues a typical melancholic,
                    mournful sound.</p>
                <p>In their music they
                    sought atonement for their deeds. It is often said
                    that Blues is the opposite of Gospel: that the latter is the music of God, where the former is
                    the music of the Devil.</p>

                <h2>Jazz</h2>
                <p>Jazz is music performed by an ensemble of players, each (very) specialized and proficient in
                    their respective instrument.</p>
                <p>The usual Jazz instruments are: trumpets, saxophones, clarinets, trombones, string-bass, and
                    piano alongside drums and a
                    jazz-guitar. The interaction between these players is crucial. Compared to Rock or Blues, Jazz
                    musicians follow no completely
                    predetermined scores. They have to “feel” what the others are about to play and how the music
                    will evolve. Yes, there are chords
                    and melodies forming an identifiable foundation for each song, but improvisation and
                    instantaneous experimentation are never
                    absent. In a way, true Jazz music can only be experienced live. Each performance is supposed to
                    be different.</p>
                <p>Jazz provides an interesting
                    combination of (lower class) African American folk music with (upper class) European amusement
                    and classical music. Jazz ensembles are divided
                    in different sections: the rhythm section (bass, drums, and piano) provide a steady beat
                    throughout the track, while the melody section (horns)
                    plays the chorus altogether and afterwards separately with solo's. The power of Jazz lies in its
                    rich contrast: improvised versus predetermination,
                    chaos versus control and light and gentle sounds versus sharp and shrill tones.</p>

                <h2>Jamaican</h2>
                <p>Jamaican music is regrettably often reduced to its most popular export, Reggae. Reggae's
                    international appeal quickly surpassed the
                    threshold which defines world music. This becomes very clear when compared to the music of
                    neighbouring countries like Cuba and
                    Haiti. But there are more Jamaican music genres that all have become more popular than world
                    music.</p>
                <p>What is even more important
                    than their popularity is the fact that Jamaican music creates a critical shackle between Rock,
                    Rap and Dance. Almost all Jamaican
                    music genres share certain characteristic.</p>
                <p>Jamaican music is focused on recording, not
                    performing. Live gigs were virtually non-existent
                    and vinyl reigned supreme. Because of sound systems, Jamaican music is made to be played
                    outdoors (with the exception of Dancehall). This is
                    particularly noticeable in the dedication (mainly amplification) on the drum and bass parts.</p>
                <P>Another characteristic of all Jamaican music is
                    a strong emphasis on the offbeat. This gives the music a laid-back sound, ideal for warm outdoor
                    weather and smoking marihuana. Indeed,
                    cannabis - cultivated on Jamaica itself - is also partly responsible for the way most Jamaican
                    music sounds, although its influence on the
                    genre must not be exaggerated.</p>

                <h2>Rap and Hip-Hop music</h2>
                <p>Hip Hop is not a genre, but a huge subculture encompassing a whole lot more than just music. Hip
                    Hop consists of what is known
                    as “the Four Elements”: breakdancing, graffiti, turntablism (mixing and scratching, the work of
                    the DJ), and rapping
                    (the work of the MC); a harmony of dance, visual art, spoken word, and technology.</p>
                <p>But Hip Hop also has its own customs,
                    an idiosyncratic “code”, enriching and defining the subculture: gang visual language for a
                    start, or an obsession with clean
                    sneakers to show respect for personal property when rappers could barely afford a second pair of
                    shoes. And let's not
                    forget “Bling Bling”: often misinterpreted for status symbols, these heavy, exuberant golden
                    necklaces and rings represent ancient
                    African warrior tribe symbols. Because Hip Hop is first and foremost a powerful stance.</p>
                <p>All Rap or Hip Hop music consists of two equally
                    important parts: the beat and the rhyme. The beat used to be made by certain old Funk (or Disco)
                    records which featured
                    breakdowns: sections with only the drummer (and bass) playing. These sections were used to
                    create a continuous (looped) breakbeat.
                    Sampling, a technique of cutting and pasting small sounds from existing records, was used to
                    complement the breakbeat with melody,
                    bass and sound effects. Though controversial from a legal point of view, the work some artists
                    devoted to create the perfect beat
                    is extraordinary, and most samples were never recognized. Since the late eighties, electronic
                    samplers could store and record a
                    variety of samples, leading to a torrent of Rap productions.</p>
                <p>The real power of Rap lies in the opportunity to convey elaborate and
                    profound messages, thanks to the continuous use of lyrics throughout the music. With more words
                    per song than any other genre, Rap can
                    amuse, protest, or connect in ways other genres cannot. Especially the latter is often
                    forgotten: early Rap tried to end ghetto
                    poverty, bigotry and racism by reaching out to white audiences, connecting remote subcultures.</p>
                <p>Rap did not only inherit the concept
                    of sound systems, DJ's with turntables, and toasting from Jamaica, but also the love for
                    cannabis. Besides Jamaican music, no
                    super-genre is as connected with the drug as Rap, though many rappers have expressed strong
                    anti-drug messages. The aural
                    psychedelic effect of marihuana synergizes well with the repetition of a looped breakbeat
                    combined with unexpected and atmospheric
                    samples, while the psychological effect on reasoning, associating, and verbalizing facilitates
                    high-tempo rapping.</p>
                <p>One must of
                    course also not forget the incredibly abundant vocabulary of Hip Hop slang, partly as a
                    consequence of marihuana use.</p>

                <h2>Techno</h2>
                <p>Techno is a bit like an abstract painting: it is an impressionistic interpretation of the Funk
                    groove inspired by futuristic visions,
                    nihilistic views, electronic circuits, or the networks of the inner mind. It is the most
                    introverted of all super-genres - the quiet
                    thinker - who likes to fiddle with technology until the wee hours of the morning. More than
                    anything else, Techno is the father of all
                    electronic Dance. Together with House, it gave offspring to countless genres.</p>
                <p>Originally, Techno was more sociologically constrained than
                    nowadays. It's bass lines are based on Funk grooves, but completely electronically made.
                    Techno uses sounds that hover in between the
                    natural and the artificial, between analogue and digital; sounds that may be real or may not.
                    Techno's funky groove becomes dance by
                    introducing repetition and more pronunciation on each 4/4 beat. Bassline and beat work strongly
                    together and are often deeper and harder than
                    House. Each and every Techno track ever created has been a quest for finding the perfect rhythm
                    through a careful combination of basslines and
                    drum kicks. Techno is usually also a tiny bit faster than House, with average BPM ranging
                    between 130 and 140. Strong influences from Electro,
                    Techno's direct forefather, surface through technological blips and sounds, which accompany the
                    rhythm without becoming melody
                    (like Trance) or ambience (like House).</p>
                <p>A very important aspect of Techno is that it's the only
                    Dance super-genre that is (almost) always
                    instrumental. House, Trance, Hardcore and others often feature vocal samples. Techno almost
                    never; it symbolizes the emancipation of
                    electronic rhythm. The rhythm is the star, the front member; there is no need for voice.</p>
                <p>In the nineties, the word Techno becomes often used
                    as an umbrella term for all Dance music. It is of course advisable to refrain from such
                    confusing and incorrect terminology, but it does
                    illustrate the exponentially rising popularity of the genre at the time. Real Techno is rather
                    limited in its amount of subgenres; its purist
                    and minimalist approach allow little room for a large variety of styles. Techno hasn't produced
                    new styles in quite some time</p>

                <h2>House</h2>
                <p>House, daughter of mother Disco, is the stereotypical feel-good dance floor music with a steady
                    beat. The most important word in the previous
                    sentence is “feel-good”. House sets itself apart from other Dance genres by providing groove and
                    soul.</p>
                <p>House is digital Rhythm 'n' Blues
                    with a feeling of playfulness, warmth and compassion. Without her focus on positive vibes, she
                    becomes another super-genre.</p>
                <p>The revolutionary rise of House (and later Techno, Hardcore, and Trance) was accelerated by
                    synergetic circumstances. Number one: new
                    drum computers and electronic music instruments emerged in the early eighties, which made music
                    making affordable for a single
                    person and even possible without education. Secondly, the discovery of XTC as the perfect party
                    drug, finally accepted by the
                    masses thanks to more powerful beats and an escapist non-stop club (disco) culture. Thirdly, the
                    shocking spread of AIDS, which
                    decimated the homosexual community in the early eighties and spread a wave of fear. Because of
                    this, House music became a substitute
                    for sex, as casual sex was deemed too dangerous. As the matter of fact, the gay crowd preferred
                    to hang around longer in clubs
                    (instead of going home with a partner) and engage in sexual dancing, sweating, teasing, touching
                    and losing itself on XTC
                    (and other drugs) in the music.</p>
                <p>All this led to longer parties, longer DJ sessions, harder
                    beats, more ecstatic sounds and the search
                    for a musical substitute for pleasure: this is House music.</p>
                <p>House is defined by a steady
                    straight 4/4 drum beat, ranging somewhere between
                    120 and 130 bpm. House has a pronounced kick drum on the quarter beat of the bar, which is
                    defined as a “four to the floor” rhythm. Of all
                    Dance genres, House diverts the least of its average tempo (123-125bpm), which makes it easy to
                    mix different records. A warm, soulful bass
                    groove or R&B influences are other stereotypical House components.</p>

                <h2>Downtempo</h2>
                <p>Downtempo is a collection of primarily electronic music with an average tempo lower than usual
                    (below 110 bpm), hence its name.</p>
                <p>Because of such a low tempo, the music is generally not meant for dancing and seldom live
                    performed. Downtempo is music to listen
                    to in a natural environment.
                    Downtempo music is often featured in film soundtracks, on albums for home
                    listening, in public places, or… at the university.</p>
                <p>Early Downtempo evolved out of academic
                    experiments with the first electronic
                    music instruments. This can even be traced back to the 1920s, when the very first electronic
                    sound was produced, thanks to
                    Léon Theremin and his homonymous instrument. To these researchers, Downtempo was not
                    particularly slow. Only many decades later,
                    after the arrival of much faster electronic dance genres, was the term “Downtempo” applied to
                    this music. Sometimes Downtempo is
                    simply referred to as “Electronic” as opposed to (Electronic) Dance (Music). Downtempo puts
                    greater emphasis on sounds and sound
                    experimentation than most super-genres. </p>
                <p>The whole history of Downtempo has been about exploring
                    and discovering new techniques and
                    sounds, and gently expanding on its discoveries. Downtempo does not choose between acoustic or
                    electronic, it includes whatever it can to
                    produce the perfect sound.</p>
                <p>The most important aspect of Downtempo however, is a radically
                    different approach on music in general. Instead
                    of working with (serial) song structure, most songs are non-serial: they evolve slowly and
                    gradually by repetition instead of structured
                    patterns. Within this seamlessly endless repetition, the mind is being taken on a transcendental
                    journey. With no pattern, no point of
                    orientation, there is no more song, only music.</p>
                <p>Downtempo asks questions about what music is,
                    instead of being an answer like other
                    genres.</p>
